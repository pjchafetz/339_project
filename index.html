        <h1>Building a Computer - Part One</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Computers are a very important part of our lives. They are used for everything from playing games to running the world's largest companies. Building a computer can be a fun and rewarding experience for those who are interested in technology and want to learn more about how a computer works. It allows you to customize and tailor your machine to your specific needs and preferences, and can often be a more affordable option compared to buying a pre-built computer. However, the process can seem intimidating to beginners, with a seemingly endless number of parts and technical jargon to navigate. In this guide, I'll break down the process of building a computer into simple steps and provide helpful tips to help you create your dream machine. Whether you're a first-time builder or looking to upgrade your existing system, this guide will give you the knowledge and confidence you need to successfully build a computer.</p>
            <p>
                This tutorial will be split into three parts. In this first part, I will go over the basic hardware components, what they do, and what you need to know before building a computer. In the second part, I will go over the actual process, providing step-by-step instructions. The third part will cover the final steps, including cable management, installing an operating system, and troubleshooting.

            <h2>The Core Parts of a Computer</h2>
            <p>
                Before we talk about the process, we must first talk about the parts. There are many different parts that go into a computer, and it can be overwhelming to know which ones you need. I will go over the most important parts and explain what you need.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</li>
                <li>Motherboard</li>
                <li>CPU Cooler</li>
                <li>Cooling system</li>
                <li>Case</li>
                <li>RAM (Random Access Memory)</li>
                <li>Storage (SSD/HDD)</li>
                <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</li>
                <li>Graphics Card (GPU)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In addition to the above parts, you will also need some basic tools, such as a screwdriver set or zip ties, to assemble the components properly.

            <h3>CPU</h3>
            <p>
                The CPU is the brain of the computer and is responsible for executing instructions that make your computer work. It is a small chip that sits in the motherboard. The main performance indicator of CPUs is determined by the clock speed, which is number of operations executed per second, in gigahertz. There are two main manufacturers of CPUs, Intel and AMD. <strong>CPUs have a specific shape, referred to as their socket type. Intel and AMD CPUs are not compatible with each other and this directly affects hardware compatibility in your build.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Motherboard</h3>
            <p>
                If the CPU is the brain, the motherboard is the heart. It is the main circuit board that connects all of the other components together. It is where the CPU is installed, as well as the RAM, storage, and other components. The motherboard is also where the power supply connects to the computer. <strong>Motherboard manufacturers create specific models for Intel and AMD sockets and are not compatible.</strong>

            <h3>Case, Cooler, and Fans</h3>
            <p>
                The case is the outer shell of the computer, where all your components will sit. It is important to choose a case that is compatible with the motherboard and other components. It is also important to choose a case that has enough space for all of your components.<br>
                
                The CPU cooler is a heat sink that is attached to the CPU to keep it cool. It is essential to keep the CPU cool to prevent it from overheating and damaging the computer. There are two main types of CPU coolers: air coolers and liquid coolers. <strong>Coolers are more forgiving, but are also generally not interchangeable.</strong><br>

                The cooling system are the additional components placed within the case. These commonly consist of only fans, but can also include custom water cooling solutions.

            <h3>RAM</h3>
            <p>
                RAM is the short-term memory of the computer. It is where the computer stores data that it is currently using. The amount of RAM you have will determine how much data the computer can store at once. RAM is measured in both quantity (number of gigabytes) and quality (speed in megahertz).

            <h3>Storage</h3>
            <p>
                The storage is where all your files and data are located and preserved. There are two main types of storage: hard disk drives (HDD) and solid state drives (SSD). HDDs are an older and slower technology, but have much larger capacity. SSDs are significantly faster and are much more common. The capacity is measured in gigabytes or terabytes and the speed is measured in megabytes transferred per second (MB/s).

            <h3>PSU</h3>
            <p>
                The PSU is the power supply unit. It is responsible for providing power to all of the components in the computer. It is important to choose a PSU that is powerful enough to power all of your components. PSUs are rated according to their wattage, which is the amount of power they can provide. Manufacturers also rate their PSUs according to their efficiency, which is the amount of power that is actually used by the components. The higher the efficiency, the less power is wasted. <strong>Do not undervalue the importance of a PSU. A cheap power supply can lead to significant hazards, including fires, short circuits, and/or destroyed components due to bad power management!</strong>

            <h3>GPU</h3>
            <p>
                The GPU is the graphics processing unit. It contains dedicated, specialized hardware for performing advanced arithmetic quickly. Therefore, it is responsible for processing all of the graphics and images that are displayed on the screen. While a CPU can process graphics, it is much slower than a GPU. The two main manufacturers of GPUs are NVIDIA and AMD. Luckily, due to standardized motherboard connectors/slots (PCIe), GPUs are interchangeable.

            <h3>Conclusion to Part 1</h3>
            <p>
                This is a brief overview of the parts that go into a computer. There are many other parts that can be added to a computer, such as a sound card, network card, and more. While this basic understanding is sufficient for most readers, the tech-curious might find it interesting to learn more about the parts in greater detail.
